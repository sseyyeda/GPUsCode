# GPUsCode

Welcome to the `GPUsCode` repository! This repository contains a collection of CUDA programs and examples for exploring various GPU programming techniques. Each subfolder in this repository features different CUDA code, demonstrating various concepts and use cases of GPU programming.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders, each containing a different CUDA project or example. Here is a brief overview of the structure:

- `HelloWorld/`: Contains a simple CUDA program that prints "helloworld" from both the CPU and GPU, and benchmarks their performance.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Provide examples and templates for various CUDA programming scenarios.
- Demonstrate basic to advanced CUDA programming techniques.
- Offer a resource for learning and experimenting with GPU programming.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CUDA programs in this repository, follow these general steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GPUsCode.git
cd GPUsCode
```

### 2. Navigate to a Specific Project

Each subfolder contains its own set of files and instructions. For example, to access the HelloWorld project:
```bash
cd HelloWorld
```

### 3. Compile and Run the Code

Each subfolder will have its own instructions for compiling and running the code. For example, in the HelloWorld folder, you might compile and run the code as follows:

- **Compile the Code:**
  ```bash
  nvcc -o helloworld helloworld.cu
  ```

- **Run the Compiled Executable:**
  ```bash
  ./helloworld
  ```
