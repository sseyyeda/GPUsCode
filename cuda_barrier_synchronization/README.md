The provided CUDA code for barrier synchronization examples focuses on demonstrating the use of `__syncthreads()` and `__syncwarp()`. The timing information for CPU and GPU execution times were from your previous matrix multiplication example and not directly related to the barrier synchronization code example. I will provide an updated `README.md` that correctly reflects the sample output for the barrier synchronization example.

Here is the updated `README.md`:

# CUDA Barrier Synchronization Example

This project demonstrates the use of different barrier synchronization mechanisms in CUDA: `__syncthreads()` and `__syncwarp()`.

## Overview

Barrier synchronization is essential in parallel programming to ensure that all threads in a block or warp reach a certain point in the code before any thread can proceed. This ensures proper coordination and data consistency.

### `__syncthreads()`

- Synchronizes all threads in a block.
- Ensures that all threads have reached the synchronization point.
- Ensures that all global and shared memory accesses made by these threads before the call to `__syncthreads()` are visible to all threads in the block.

### `__syncwarp()`

- Synchronizes all threads in a warp (32 threads).
- Useful for situations where only warp-level synchronization is required.
- More efficient than block-level synchronization.

## Example Code

The provided CUDA code demonstrates the use of both `__syncthreads()` and `__syncwarp()`.

### Key Points

- The kernel function `exampleKernel` uses shared memory to perform operations on the data.
- `__syncthreads()` is used to synchronize all threads in the block before and after modifying the shared memory.
- `__syncwarp()` is used to synchronize all threads in a warp, ensuring that the print statement is executed by only one thread per warp.

### Sample Output

The sample output of the above code will look like:

```text
Warp 0 reached this point
Warp 1 reached this point
Warp 2 reached this point
Warp 3 reached this point
Warp 4 reached this point
Warp 5 reached this point
Warp 6 reached this point
Warp 7 reached this point
```

## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sseyyeda/GPUsCode.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd GPUsCode/cuda_barrier_synchronization
    ```

3. **Compile the code using `nvcc`**:
    ```sh
    nvcc -o example src/main.cu
    ```

4. **Run the executable**:
    ```sh
    ./example
    ```

## Conclusion

This example highlights the importance and usage of barrier synchronization in CUDA programming. Proper synchronization ensures correct execution order and data consistency among threads, which is crucial for parallel programming.
